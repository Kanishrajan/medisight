An end-to-end analytics platform for monitoring, analyzing, and optimizing hospital operations across multiple departments and branches. The system provides real-time visibility into patient flow, bed occupancy, doctor utilization, procedure volumes, costs, and outcomes, enabling data-driven operational and capacity planning decisions.

This project implements a Firebase-based backend integrated with BI tools (Power BI / Tableau / Superset) to deliver interpretable dashboards for non-technical hospital administrators.
